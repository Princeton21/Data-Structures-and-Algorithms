# Kadane’s Algorithm
_Kadane’s algorithm is an iterative dynamic programming algorithm in which we search for a maximum sum contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional numeric array._

## Qusetion on Kadane's Algorithm
Write an efficient program to find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers that has the largest sum.

## Initialize:
- max_so_far = INT_MIN
- max_ending_here = 0

* Loop for each element of the array
   *  1. max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i]
   * 2. if(max_so_far < max_ending_here)
	    * max_so_far = max_ending_here
   * 3.  if(max_ending_here < 0)
          * max_ending_here = 0
      * return max_so_far



# Explanation: 
The simple idea of Kadane’s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array (max_ending_here is used for this). And keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments (max_so_far is used for this). 
Each time we get a positive-sum compare it with max_so_far and update max_so_far if it is greater than max_so_far 

## Lets take the example:
    {-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3}

    max_so_far = max_ending_here = 0

    for i=0,  a[0] =  -2
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-2)
    Set max_ending_here = 0 because max_ending_here < 0

    for i=1,  a[1] =  -3
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-3)
    Set max_ending_here = 0 because max_ending_here < 0

    for i=2,  a[2] =  4
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (4)
    max_ending_here = 4
    max_so_far is updated to 4 because max_ending_here greater 
    than max_so_far which was 0 till now

    for i=3,  a[3] =  -1
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-1)
    max_ending_here = 3

    for i=4,  a[4] =  -2
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-2)
    max_ending_here = 1

    for i=5,  a[5] =  1
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (1)
    max_ending_here = 2

    for i=6,  a[6] =  5
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (5)
    max_ending_here = 7
    max_so_far is updated to 7 because max_ending_here is 
    greater than max_so_far

    for i=7,  a[7] =  -3
    max_ending_here = max_ending_here + (-3)
    max_ending_here = 4.

## Code for the problem and above given explanation 

#include&lt;iostream>
#include&lt;climits>
using namespace std;
 
int maxSubArraySum(int a[], int size)
{
    int max_so_far = INT_MIN, max_ending_here = 0;
 
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
    {
        max_ending_here = max_ending_here + a[i];
        if (max_so_far < max_ending_here)
            max_so_far = max_ending_here;
 
        if (max_ending_here < 0)
            max_ending_here = 0;
    }
    return max_so_far;
}
 
int main()
{
    int a[] = {-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3};
    int n = sizeof(a)/sizeof(a[0]);
    int max_sum = maxSubArraySum(a, n);
    cout << "Maximum contiguous sum is " << max_sum;
    return 0;
}

## Output:

Maximum contiguous sum is 7
