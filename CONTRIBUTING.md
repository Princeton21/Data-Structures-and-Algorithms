## Contribution Guidelines

The repository has multiple folders with self explanatory names. Choose the folder and the sub-folder which you think will be fit for your contribution and then see if a folder of the algorithm/solution you intend to contribute has a folder of it's own. If not, add the folder with the name of your algorithm/solution and then add the source file of your code with the same name as the folder in the folder itself. This is to make sure that the file structure looks clean and tidy. Not conforming to these guidelines may lead to your pull request not being merged into the main branch.
